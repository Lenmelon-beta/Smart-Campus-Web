# CustomAuth
Everthing is working fine but the narbar is'nt working as i wanted it to but ill have lisa work on it
the login function work with other a problem it's just the logout part that is having a problem 
i tried looking it up but no luck so far
the UserLogins are store in a local database right now im looking for a way to connect this to a azure cloud one to make easier for us to manage the user access
to the database.


# Post-creation notes
if anyone wants to use this, they'll need to contact liam as he needs to start up the database for it to run the chat page
